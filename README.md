Hey guys ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

So, my first javascript project and readme file also.

HOW TO USE:

Its really easy to use as it is a simple watch which we usually find in our homes,
just in a vibrant color so that it looks good and soothing.

SOURCE OF PROJECT:

This project was a result of following a short tutorial in which
I was learning JavaSript. So, when I see the final outcome, it was really worth it and
helpful too.
 
A BIG THANKS TO YOUTUBE:))

UPDATES COMING:

So, I have decided that the next thing I would add to this project 
is a stopwatch feature so that it can become more interactive and fascinating
and some more features too.
